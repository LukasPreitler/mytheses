### Taxes and Revenues for Austria; Estimation of the Laffer Curve and Simulation of an Equilibrium Model
This was the hardest work. Clear it is a Master these, but first I want to write another these. My Idea to estimate was the wage-motivation-theory which data of the food-retailers, but there was noway to get them.
Then I must look for another these, this was the Laffer Curve estimation. Long story short, first it was hard to get the data and then the model doesn't work even it was published in a journal and I had to look for another model. An equilibrium equation model of different economic agents.
I code the model in R.
